The DinoAI uses DQN, a reinforcement algorithm, to learn how to play the Google DINO game. 

## Requirements

I notice that this works well with only Python 3.7 so you will need that version. There is some conflict between the StableBaseline3 version and the Gym version so you will need to use the versions specified in the requirements.txt

You will also need to have Google Tesseract Installed to use pyTesseract.

## Configure

In the WebGame class, you must change the game location coordinates because it differ by the laptop monitor's size.
